# ML_Projects
In this repo includes some basic ml projects I developed during learning machine learning

1. First project is BMI calculator
This project predicts an individual's BMI category (Extremly Weak, Weak, Normal, Overweight, Obesity) using height and weight as input. It includes synthetic or real dataset usage, BMI calculation, category labeling, model training with a Decision Tree, and deployment with Gradio.

2. Second is Flight Delay Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a flight will be delayed by more than 15 minutes based on features like airline, departure time, distance, and day of the week. It includes exploratory data analysis, feature encoding, model training with Random Forest, and evaluation using accuracy and classification reports.
This project deploy using streamlit
